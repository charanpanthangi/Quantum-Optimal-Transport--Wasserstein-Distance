# Quantum Optimal Transport – Quantum Wasserstein Distance with PennyLane

This repository is a beginner-friendly walkthrough of how **optimal transport** ideas can be paired with **quantum circuits**. We build a tiny 1D generative model and train it using a **quantum Wasserstein-like loss** inspired by Wasserstein GANs. Everything is heavily commented and intentionally lightweight so it runs on CPU.

## What this project does
- Defines a toy bimodal 1D data distribution (our "real" data).
- Builds a small parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) that acts as a generator for a model distribution.
- Builds a second PQC as a **critic** that estimates a Wasserstein-like distance between real and generated samples.
- Trains the generator to minimize this distance, WGAN style, while also computing the **classical Wasserstein-1 distance** in 1D as ground truth.
- Produces SVG plots that compare real vs. generated samples and show how classical and quantum Wasserstein estimates evolve.

## Why quantum optimal transport is interesting
- Optimal transport and Wasserstein distances are strong metrics for comparing probability distributions and power many generative models.
- Quantum circuits can represent probability distributions in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, giving expressive modeling capacity.
- Quantum Wasserstein-like metrics may offer advantages for complex data by leveraging quantum feature maps and trainable observables.

## Why SVG instead of PNG
GitHub's CODEX interface cannot preview binary image files like PNG or JPG and often shows messages such as "Binary files are not supported". To avoid this, all visualizations in this repository are saved as lightweight **SVG** vector images. SVGs are text-based, easy to diff, and render cleanly inside GitHub and CODEX.

## How it works (plain English)
1. Sample data from a simple two-peak distribution on [-1, 1].
2. Encode 1D values into single-qubit states using rotation gates.
3. Use a quantum **generator** circuit to produce model samples by mapping measurement probabilities to real numbers.
4. Use a quantum **critic** circuit to score samples; the difference between real and fake scores approximates a Wasserstein distance.
5. Train the critic to separate real vs. fake and the generator to fool the critic (Wasserstein GAN style).
6. Compute the classical 1D Wasserstein-1 distance as a reference during training.

## Repository structure
- `app/` – dataset, classical Wasserstein, quantum embedding, generator, critic, losses, training loop, and SVG plotting utilities.
- `notebooks/` – `qot_demo.ipynb` interactive walkthrough.
- `examples/` – SVG figures generated by the demo scripts.
- `tests/` – lightweight pytest checks for each component.

## How to run
Install dependencies and run the CLI demo:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/main.py
```

To explore interactively:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/qot_demo.ipynb
```

## What you should see
- Histograms comparing real vs. generated samples.
- Curves for classical W₁ and the quantum Wasserstein-like estimate over training.
- Final bar comparison between classical and quantum distances.

## Future work
- Explore higher-dimensional data and more expressive PQCs.
- Add stronger Lipschitz enforcement for the critic (e.g., gradient penalties).
- Connect to more formal quantum optimal transport constructions.
